This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A simple project to highlight how dead-naming someone feels.
The app has an input that asks for the user's name.
When the Submit button is clicked the text "Welcome Back, Kat!" is displayed regardless of the name entered.
This highlights how annoying it is when someone ignores your chosen name and calls you something different because they have a fixed mindset.
Trans rights are human rights!
